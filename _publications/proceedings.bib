  abstract     = {In the light of the recent publication of Greaves et al. (2020)         reporting the first detection of phosphine in the Venusian         clouds, we decided to explore the SOIR database in search for         traces of PH$_{3}$ in the Infrared range.         \textbackslash\textbackslashThe Solar Occultation in the         InfraRed (SOIR) instrument onboard the ESA Venus Express         spacecraft, an infrared spectrometer sensitive from 2.2 to 4.3         {\ensuremath{\mu}}m, probed the atmosphere of Venus from June         2006 until December 2014. During this time, it performed more         than 750 solar occultations of the Venus mesosphere and lower         thermosphere, at a spectral resolution of 0.12-0.18 cm$^{-1}$,         the highest on board Venus Express. SOIR gathered information on         the atmosphere of Venus by looking at the Sun through Venus'         atmosphere as the satellite passed into and out of eclipse. As         the light beam probes deeper layers in the atmosphere, two         processes reducing the transmittance take place: extinction by         aerosols and absorption by trace gases. Measurements were made         from the top of the atmosphere (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde         170km altitude) down to the cloud tops         (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 62km). High resolution         vertical profiles of the concentration of various elements were         retrieved, such as H$_{2}$O [Chamberlain et al., 2020], CO$_{2}$         [Mahieux et al., 2015], CO [Vandaele et al., 2015], SO$_{2}$         [Mahieux et al., 2015], hydrogen halides (HCl, HF) [Mahieux et         al., 2015]. \textbackslash\textbackslashAdditionally, we         investigate the potential to detect this molecule with an         infrared spectrometer that would sound the Venus' atmosphere in         nadir viewing. VenSpec-H is part of the payload of the candidate         M5 mission EnVision. The ESA selection is expected in June 2021         for a launch in 2032. The scientific objectives of VenSpec-H         consist in measuring abundances of molecular species such as         H$_{2}$O, HDO, CO, OCS and SO$_{2}$, in the troposphere and in         the mesosphere of Venus. This would be achieved by measuring the         infrared range between 1 and 2.5 microns at a high spectral         resolution. \textbackslash\textbackslashThe methodologies we         used to derive upper limits of PH$_{3}$ from the SOIR and         VenSpec-H observations will be discussed.},

  abstract     = {VESPA (Virtual European Solar and Planetary Access) has been focusing for nearly 10 years on adapting Virtual Observatory (VO) techniques to handle Planetary Science data [1] [2]. The objective of this activity is to build a contributive data distribution system where data services are located and maintained in research institutes, as well as in space agencies and observatories. VESPA is part of Europlanet, a series of programs funded by the European Union and dedicated to enforcing collaborative activities in Planetary Science both within and outside Europe. A new program called Europlanet-2024 has started in 2020 for a 4-year period.  During the previous Europlanet-2020 program, VESPA has defined an architecture adapted from the astronomy VO, and incorporating concepts and standards from other areas (Earth observation, Heliophysics, etc). The basic system uses the VO infrastructure: data services are installed in any location but are declared in a system of harvested registries with identifiers, end-point (URL), mention of supported access protocols, and rough description of content. Such services are interoperable via clients and tools, which also provide visualization and analysis functions.  
 
Data description:  VESPA has adopted the Table Access Protocol (TAP) from the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) to query data services.  In addition to this general mechanism, the EPNCore vocabulary has been designed to provide a uniform metadata system describing observational, instrumental, and physical parameters with fixed names, scales, and units. EPNCore encompasses all fields of Solar System studies and supports simulations and experimental data as well as observational ones. It can be extended to new parameters whenever required. Beyond TAP, EPNCore provides a handy parameter description system that can be used in various contexts, including with personal databases in the course of a research program.  A PDS4 dictionary has been provided for future conversion schemes with modern space agency archives. ENPCore is both a project study of the International Planetary Data Alliance (IPDA), and an emerging standard of the IVOA (currently under review to become a proposed recommendation [3]). 
 
Data access and tools:  Since VESPA data services are responsive to TAP, they can be queried by all TAP clients {--} either web interfaces, java tools, python libraries, Jupyter notebooks, etc. Some VO tools include specific support for EPN-TAP (i.e., using EPNCore with TAP).  The VESPA portal (http://vespa.obspm.fr) is a dedicated web interface oriented towards data discovery, that can query all public EPN-TAP services simultaneously; it also converts EPN-TAP queries to NASA keyword-search queries and the older PDAP protocol. The portal also uses VO-compliant web services as support applications, e.g. Miriade (ephemeris system), quaero (name resolver for solar system objects) and WebGeoCalc (SPICE computation).  All tools and search interfaces in the VO can exchange data via a specific protocol called SAMP.},

  abstract     = {Sensitivity to mechanical vibrations of Fourier Transform Spectrometers (FTS) is a well-known phenomenon. It is especially critical for FTS devoted to atmospheric studies (like the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS) onboard Mars Express 2003), as absorption bands for the gases of low concentration are comparable with the generated instrument spectral noise. The adopted techniques for the vibration sensitivity reduction suffer of limitations in practical implementation, leaving residual modulations of the interferogram and the so-called ghosts in the spectra. Moreover as it is often impossible to measure the vibrations during the FTS measurement, the position and magnitude of these ghosts cannot be evaluated. Up to now the adopted ghost reduction techniques are mostly based on the averaging of spectra, because the disturbance phase is randomly distributed. This paper presents an innovative data treatment technique which allows single spectrum correction from distortions of unknown nature. Such a technique would increase the spatial resolution of the mapping process and becomes crucial when the desired information is linked to a particular mapping area associated to an individual spectrum. The full study consists in the explicit analysis of the ghost formation and the post-processing algorithm based on the semiblind deconvolution method ? an iterative numerical algorithm of the series of consecutive deconvolutions. The technique was tested on the data from the PFS and the algorithm proved to be consistent according to the selected efficiency criteria (coming from the available general information about the signal spectral shape).},

In many actual problems, the model is a coarse approximation of the system physics and independence can be more or less satisfied, and consequently results are not reliable. Moreover, with many actual data, there is a lack of reliable knowledge on the sources to be extracted, and the interpretation of the independent components (IC) must be done very carefully, using partial prior information and with interactive discussions with experts. In this talk, we explain how such a scientific method can take place on the example of analysis of Mars hyperspectral images.},

This high resolution, and its spectral range, give the ability to pinpoint chemical species on Mars more accurately than before. The subject of this paper is to present a method to extract informations on chemicals using hyperspectral images. We propose to combine spatial Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [1] and spectral Bayesian Positive Source Separation (BPSS) [2]. The basic idea is to use spatial ICA yielding a rough classification of pixels, which allows selection of small, but relevant, number of pixels. BPSS is then applied for the estimation of the source spectra using this reduced set of pixels. Finally, the abundances of the components is assessed on the whole pixels of the images. Results of this approach are shown and evaluated by comparison with reference spectra.},

  abstract     = {In order to understand Mars' current climate it is necessary to detect, characterize and monitor CO2 and H2O at the surface (permanent and seasonal icy deposits) and in the atmosphere (vapor and clouds). Here we will focus on the South Seasonal Polar Cap (SSPC) whose recession was previously observed with different techniques : from earth in the visible range with HST [James 1996], or from MGS spacecraft with MOC images [Benson 2005], in the thermal IR range by the TES [Kieffer 2000], in the near infrared by OMEGA/MEX [Langevin submitted]. The time and space evolutions of the SSPC is a major annual climatic signal both at the global and the regional scales. In particular the measurement of the temporal and spatial distributions of CO2 constrains exchange processes between both surface and atmosphere. This exchange may involve preponderant species : H2O, CO2 and dust. In this work we will apply a new detection technique : "wavanglet" in order to follow the recession of the SSPC thanks to OMEGA/MEX observations. This method was especially developed in the goal to classify a huge dataset, such OMEGA ones. We propose to use "wavanglet" as a supervised automatic classification method that identifies spectral features and classifies the image in spectrally homogeneous units. Additionally we will evaluate quantitative detection limits of "wavanglet" based on synthetic dataset simulating OMEGA spectra in typical situation of the SSPC. This detection limit will be discussed in terms of abundance for H2O and CO2 ices in order to improve the interpretation of the classification. Finally we will present the recession of the SSPC using "wavanglet" and we will compare the results with those of earlier investigation. An interpretation of the similarities and disagreements between those maps will be done.},
